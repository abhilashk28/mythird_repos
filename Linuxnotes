LINUX CLASS-1
LINUX:
Linux is an free and Open-source operating system with high security. Linux is multi user based OS.
OS: Operating System
An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between computer hardware components and the user.
Every computer system must have at least one operating system to run other programs. Applications like Browsers, MS Offi ce, Notepad Games, etc., need some environment to run and perform its tasks.
TYPES OF OS:
Key Features of Linux:
Linux follows the open-source model.
Linux has multiuser and multitasking capabilities.
Security features.
Linux is used for servers, embedded systems, supercomputers, etc
LINUX OS DISTRIBUTIONS:
Many of the users taken the linux OS and modifi ed according to their requirements and released into the market with diff erent names called Linux distribution.
RedHat
Ubuntu
Debian
Centos
Fedora
Opensuse
Kali Linux
Amazon Linux
Rocky Linux
HISTORY:On Sep 17th 1991, Linus Torvalds a student at the university of Helsinki, Finland, He released the fi rst version of the Linux kernel, known as Linux 0.01, as open-source software.
The Linux kernel is written in C language.
He wrote this program specially for his own PC
Firstly he wanted to name it as 'Freax' but later it became 'Linux'.
Today, supercomputers, smart phones, desktop, web servers, tablet, laptops and home appliances like washing machines, DVD players, routers, modems, cars, refrigerators, etc use Linux OS.
KERNEL:
It is the core or the heart of the operating system. It's the central part that manages and facilitates communication between the computer's hardware and software.
SHELL:
A shell that allows users to interact with the operating system. There are two types of shells.
Command Line Interface (CLI): Executes the command provided by user given in the form command and display the output in terminal.
Executes the process provided by user in graphical way and output is displayed in the graphical window.
COMMAND:
It is an instruction/request given to the operating system by a user.
It tells computer to perform a particular task.
TERMINAL:
It is a text-based interface that allows you to interact with the operating system by typing commands.
It's a way for you to communicate with the linux machines.
LETS DIVE INTO PRACTICAL SESSION:
By default we are in ec2-user, but if we want to perform any action we should be in root user
because, root is the ultimate king of linux, root has full permissions, so that we can run any command anywhere.
To login as root user : sudo -i
Here sudo : super user do
to logout from root user and go back to ec2-user : exit
In Linux we have diff erent types of commands
SYSTEM COMMANDS
HARDWARE COMMANDS
FILE COMMANDS
PERMISSION COMMANDS
USER COMMANDS
SEARCH COMMANDS
NETWORKING COMMANDS
SYSTEM COMMANDS: Used to get system information
uname : used to get type of OS
uname -r : used to get kernel version of our OS
uname -a : used to get full info about OS
clear: this command is used to clear the clear (or) you can use ctrl + l as a short cut
uptime : used to get since how long our system is in running state
uptime -p : this will give only time

timedatectl : used to get timezones
timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata : used to change Timezone to IST

SOME EXTRA COMMANDS FOR PRACTICE:

date +”%y” : to get only year
date +”%H” : used to get Hours
date +”%M” : used to get Minutes

LINUX CLASS 3
ll : used to see the list of fi les in order (A-Z)
ll -t : used to see the list of the fi les based on modifi cation/creation time
ll -r : used to see the fi les in reverse order (Z to A)
ll -a : used to see all fi les including hidden
CAT COMMAND:
cat command is used to read the data from a fi le, it is also used to append the data in a fi le
cat fi lename: used to read the data from a fi le
cat>fi lename : used to overwrite the data
cat>>fi lename: used to append the data
NOTE: Cat command is used to append the data, but here the problem is, it is not possible to modify the data. To avoid this issue we can use editor in linux.
There are 2 types of editors in linux
Vim editor
Nano editor
VIM EDITOR: It is used to edit the fi les in linux machines, It has 3 modes
Command mode
Insert mode
Save & quit mode
To open any fi le in vim editor : vim fi lename (or) vi fi lename
1. COMMAND MODE: this is the default mode in vim editor, It is used to perform some actions like used to copy the data, delete the data and we can make undo and redo the changes as well.
gg : used to go to 1st line of the fi le
G : used to go to last line of the fi le
M : used to go to middle of the fi le
4gg : used to go to 4th line of the fi le
17gg : used to go to 17th line of the fi le
:23 : used to go to 23rd line of the fi le
:set number : used to set numbers of the fi le
yy : used to copy the line
4yy : used to copy 4 lines from our cursor
p : paste the copied content
10p : paste the copied content 10 times
dd : used to delete the line
5dd : used to delete 5 lines from the cursor
u : used to undo the changes
crtl + r : used to redo the changes.
/word : used to search for a word in a fi le
?word : used to search for a word in a fi le
:%s/old/new/ : used to replace
2. INSERT MODE: This mode is used to insert the data or make any modifi cations in a fi le.
To go to insert mode : i
To go back to command mode : esc
To go to the ending of the line : A
To go to starting of this line : I
To create a new line above the cursor : O
To create a new line below the cursor : o
DIFFERENCE B/W COMMAND MODE KEYS & INSERT MODE.
If we perform command mode keys we will be in command mode only
If we perform insert mode keys we will go to insert mode.
3. SAVE & QUIT MODE: This is used to save the data and quit from vim editor
To save the data - :w
To quit from vim editor - :q
To quit forcefully - :q!
To save & quit at a time - :wq
To save & quit forcefully at a time - :wq!

LINUX CLASS 5
USER COMMANDS:
to create user : useradd username
to see all users : getent passwd (or) cat /etc/passwd
to check a specifi c user : id username
to set a password to user : passwd username
to switch to user : su - username
to delete a user : userdel username (this will delete only user & group)
to delete a user : userdel -r username (this will delete all user, group & path also)
NOTE:
WHENEVER WE CREATE A USER THEN AUTOMATICALLY GROUP WILL BE CREATE.
WHENEVER WE CRATE A USER, THEN AUTOMATICALLY PATH WILL BE CREATE.
WE CANT DELETE THE GROUPS DIRECTLY WHICH ARE CREATED BY THE USERS, IF WE DELETE USER THEN AUTOMATICALLY GROUP WILL BE DELETE
UNDERSTAND THE USER:
shiva:x:1001:1001::/home/shiva:/bin/bash
shiva == username
x == it stores the users password
1001 == UID (User ID)
1001 == GID (Group ID)
/home/shiva == this is user path
/bin/bash = users shell path
GROUP COMMANDS:
to create a group : groupadd groupname
to see the list of groups : getent group (or) cat /etc/group
to delete a group : groupdel group-name
to add a user to a group : usermod -a -G group-name user-name
CHANGING THE OWNERS OF A FILE :
to change the user of a fi le : chown username fi lename
to change the user of a multiple fi les : chown username fi le1 fi le2 fi le3
to change the user of all the fi les : chown username *
to change the group of a fi le : chgrp groupname fi lename
to change the group of a multiple fi les : chgrp groupname fi le1 fi le2 fi le3
to change the group of all the fi les : chgrp username *
to change user & group at a time to a fi le : chown user:group fi lename
to change user & group at a time to a multiple fi les : chown user:group fi le1 fi le2
to change user & group at a time to a all fi les : chown user:group *
to change owner of a folder only : chown user:group foldername
to change the owners of a folder along with fi les inside the folder : chown -R useR:group folder.
PERMISSIONS OF A FILE:
whenever we create a fi le, we will get the default permissions like this rw-r--r--
Now lets understand the permissions by taking the default permissions
USER PERMISSION : rw-
GROUP PERMISSIONS : r--
OTHERS PERMISSIONS : r--
Here,
R = Read -----> 4
W = write -----> 2
X = Execute ----> 1
- = Nothing ----> 0
RW- = 4+2+0 = 6
R-- = 4+0+0 = 4
R-- = 4+0+0 = 4
FINALLY, FOR OUR FILE CONTAINS 644 PERMISSIONS BY DEFUALT
ex:
user = rwx --------> 4+2+1 = 7
group = --x -------> 0+0+1 = 1
others = r-x -------> 4+0+1 = 5
715
ex:
r-x = 5
-w- = 2
r-- = 4
To change the permission of a fi le : chmod 777 fi lename
To change the permissions of a multiple fi les : chmod 751 fi le1 fi le2 fi le3
To change the permission of a folder : chmod 111 folder
To change the permission of a multiple folders : chmod 777 folder1 folder2 folder3
To change the permissions of all fi les : chmod 777 *
To change the permissions of folders and all fi les inside the folder : chmod -R 777 folder
